Hi!

During the day I write code, & by night I write code & crochet things.

I :heart: open source & open data, a love inspired by my first developer role with **Flax & Teal** in Belfast. I worked with **PHP**, **Laravel**, **Python** and **Vue.js**, & also played with open data.
  
At the moment I work at the **BBC** in the Archive Services team, mainly using **React**, **Node.js**, & random **AWS** tech like Lambda, S3, CloudFormation.
 
Things change so quickly - it's  more important to have passion for what you do, rather than knowing exactly what you're doing.

I've organised events & volunteered for various organisations, such as Code Co-Op, Farset Labs, & Belfast Tech Families. 

I occasionally write blogs, technical and non-technical, which are currently on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gingerzoealex).
